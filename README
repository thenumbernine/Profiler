C++ profiling code

just put PROFILE() at the beginning of whatever code you want to profile
optionally PROFILE_BEGIN_FRAME() and PROFILE_END_FRAME() around your execution loop

upon exit produces a call stack of functions with the following information:
- how much time, including child calls, it contributed to each frame's execution
- how much time, excluding child calls, it contributed to each frame's execution
- what order it was in performance based on the exclusive time calculations
- who called who

it currently depends on headers found in the GLApp project
